## About Me

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a web development student with a passion for game development and front-end design. My goal is to blend my love for creating engaging web experiences with my aspiration to develop compelling games.

ðŸ’» Currently, Iâ€™m diving into various programming languages, including C#, as I work towards becoming a proficient game developer. I'm also keen on front-end technologies, aiming to specialize in web design and development.

ðŸŽ¨ In addition to coding, I enjoy drawing in pixel art, which I use for both my game projects and web designs. I find pixel art to be a fantastic way to express creativity and add a unique touch to my work.

ðŸŽ® My dream is to develop games reminiscent of the classic titles that challenged players and offered a complete experience without the need for additional DLCs or in-game purchases. Iâ€™m inspired by games that reward skill and offer a satisfying journey from start to finish.

ðŸŒŸ Iâ€™m dedicated to learning and growing in the fields of game development and web design, and Iâ€™m excited about the possibilities that lie ahead!
